## Request for Proposal

The Request for Proposal (RFP) is a system where you, as a participant can express interest in learning any aspect of Golang, or something from its ecosystem.

By floating your RFP in the community, you may find like-minded individuals who are also interested in the same topic(s). They may either provide you with more reference material, or may join you in the quest for a `proposal` by upvoting your RFP.

As a community, we hope to find individuals who have expertise in the RFP topics, who may make a proposal to address your request.
